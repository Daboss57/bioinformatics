# PGIP Frontend (Placeholder)

This directory will house the TypeScript/React application for exploring pangenome graphs, annotations, and benchmarking dashboards. The UI implementation begins in a later milestone. For now, this README captures design intentions and component sketches.

## Planned Tech Stack

- React (with Vite) + TypeScript
- GraphQL client (Urql or Apollo)
- TailwindCSS + headless UI primitives
- D3/React Flow/HiGlass for interactive genome and graph visualization
- State management via Zustand

## Early Ideas

- Variant search bar with autosuggest (ES-backed)
- Graph diff viewer comparing individuals vs pangenome paths
- Annotation provenance timeline and benchmarking charts
- Expression overlay heatmaps from GTEx

Contributions focused on design mockups, UX research, or component prototyping are welcome even before the full stack is in place.
