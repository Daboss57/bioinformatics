# PGIP CLI (Placeholder)

The PGIP command-line interface will provide power users with scripted access to variant search, plugin execution, workflow submission, and dataset management. This README tracks the evolving interface design.

## Proposed Features

- `pgip ingest` – Register new VCFs, GFA graphs, or expression matrices
- `pgip annotate` – Trigger annotation plugin runs and monitor provenance
- `pgip plugins` – List available plugins, inspect manifests, manage versions
- `pgip cohort` – Manage cohort metadata, summary statistics, and permissions
- `pgip export` – Extract results for downstream analysis (CSV/Parquet/JSON-L)

Implementation will begin once the backend API stabilizes. Feel free to draft CLI usage examples or propose additional commands in GitHub issues.
