# PGIP Documentation Hub

Welcome to the documentation workspace for the PanGenome Insight Platform. This folder holds reference material, design docs, plugin contracts, roadmap notes, and onboarding guides. The initial structure will grow over time.

## Current Contents

- `plugin-spec.md` – Contract for annotation plugins and ML predictors.
- `architecture-overview.md` – Expanded description of services and data flow (future milestone).
- `roadmap.md` – Detailed semester-by-semester goals (future milestone).
- `adrs/` – Architecture Decision Records (to be added after the first ADR is authored).

## Contributing to Docs

1. Keep Markdown lint-friendly (one sentence per line preferred).
2. Use fenced code blocks with language hints where applicable.
3. Update the table of contents above when you add a new top-level document.
4. For diagrams, prefer Mermaid or PlantUML source files committed alongside exported images.

Thanks for helping make PGIP approachable for new contributors!
